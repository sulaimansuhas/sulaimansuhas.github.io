Things to do
>Refactoring
- Change how we deal with images, captions, and alternative text by creating an object to store all the data modularly
- Rename IconContainment to something like ZoomOnHover as component function has changed

>Formatting, linting, and general housekeeping
- set up prettier, this code is getting a bit desgoostang
- figure out the lsp's problem with importing images( can checkout why it has issues with styled components of lesser importance tho)
- figuring out how to set up linting rules would be quite cool. (Example would be to warn for leftover console.log statements)
- make this todo section sexier.
  - have tick boxes instead of bullet points
